# Change query before the search engine is executed

This is a sample publishing template that allows you to modify the search query before the search engine executes it.

In this example the string "modified" is added at the end of the search query entered by the user. 

To modify the functionality you will have to edit the custom.js file found at: _${pubishingTemplateFolder}/js/custom.js_
